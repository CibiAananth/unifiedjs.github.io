## Using unified

This guide delves into how unified can be used to transform a Markdown file to
HTML.
Itâ€™ll also show how to generate a table of contents, and sidestep into checking
prose.

### Tree transformations

For this example, weâ€™ll start out with Markdown content, then transform to HTML.
We need a Markdown parser and an HTML stringifier for that.
The relevant projects are respectively [`remark-parse`][parse] and
[`rehype-stringify`][stringify].
To transform between the two syntaxes, weâ€™ll use
[`remark-rehype`][remark-rehype].
Finally, weâ€™ll use unified itself to glue these together, and
[`unified-stream`][unified-stream] for streaming.

First set up a project.
Create a folder, `example`, enter it, and initialize a new project:

```sh
mkdir example
cd example
npm init -y
```

Then make sure the project is a module, so that `import` and `export` work,
by changing `package.json`:

```diff
--- a/package.json
+++ b/package.json
@@ -2,6 +2,7 @@
   "name": "example",
   "version": "1.0.0",
   "description": "",
+  "type": "module",
   "main": "index.js",
   "scripts": {
     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
```

Now letâ€™s install the needed dependencies with [npm][], which comes bundled with
[Node][].

```sh
npm install unified unified-stream remark-parse remark-rehype rehype-stringify
```

Now create a Markdown file, `example.md`, that weâ€™re going to transform.

```markdown
# Hello World

## Table of Content

## Install

A **example**.

## Use

More `text`.

## License

MIT
```

Then create `index.js` as well.
Itâ€™ll transform Markdown to HTML.
Itâ€™s hooked up to read from stdin and write to stdout.

```javascript
import {stream} from 'unified-stream'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'

const processor = unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkRehype)
  .use(rehypeStringify)

process.stdin.pipe(stream(processor)).pipe(process.stdout)
```

Now, running our script with [Node][] (this uses your Shell to read
`example.md` and write `example.html`):

```sh
node index.js < example.md > example.html
```

â€¦gives us an `example.html` file that looks as follows:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>Table of Content</h2>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>A <strong>example</strong>.</p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>More <code>text</code>.</p>
<h2>License</h2>
<p>MIT</p>
```

> Note that [`remark-rehype`][remark-rehype] doesnâ€™t deal with HTML inside the
> Markdown.
> Youâ€™ll need [`rehype-raw`][rehype-raw] if youâ€™re planning on doing that.

Nifty!
It doesnâ€™t do much yet, but weâ€™ll get there.
In the next section, weâ€™ll make this more useful by introducing plugins.

### Plugins

Weâ€™re still missing some things, notably a table of contents, and proper HTML
document structure.

We can use [`remark-slug`][slug] and [`remark-toc`][toc] for the former, and
[`rehype-document`][document] to do the latter tasks.

```sh
npm install remark-slug remark-toc rehype-document
```

Letâ€™s now use those two as well, by modifying our `index.js` file:

```diff

 import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'
+import rehypeDocument from 'rehype-document'
 import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'

 const processor = unified()
   .use(remarkParse)
+  .use(remarkSlug)
+  .use(remarkToc)
   .use(remarkRehype)
+  .use(rehypeDocument, {title: 'Contents'})
   .use(rehypeStringify)

 process.stdin.pipe(stream(processor)).pipe(process.stdout)
```

We pass options to `rehype-document`.
In this case, we use that to make sure we get a proper `<title>` element in our
`<head>`, as required by the HTML specification.
More options are accepted by `rehype-document`, such as which language tag to
use.
These are described in detail in its [`readme.md`][document].
Many other plugins accept options as well, so make sure to read through their
docs to learn more.

> Note that remark plugins work on a Markdown tree, and rehype plugins work on
> an HTML tree.
> Itâ€™s important that you place your `.use` calls in the correct places.

Now, when running our script like before, weâ€™d get the following `example.html`
file:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Contents</title>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
</head>
<body>
<h1 id="hello-world">Hello World</h1>
<h2 id="table-of-content">Table of Content</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="#install">Install</a></li>
<li><a href="#use">Use</a></li>
<li><a href="#license">License</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
<p>A <strong>example</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="use">Use</h2>
<p>More <code>text</code>.</p>
<h2 id="license">License</h2>
<p>MIT</p>
</body>
</html>
```

> You may noticed the document isnâ€™t formatted nicely.
> Thereâ€™s a plugin for that though!
> Feel free to add [`rehype-format`][rehype-format] to the plugins, below `doc`!

Youâ€™re acing it!
This is getting pretty useful, right?

In the next section, weâ€™ll lay the groundwork for creating a report.

### Reporting

Before we check some prose (yes, weâ€™re getting there), weâ€™ll first switch up our
`index.js` file to print a pretty report (weâ€™ll fill it in the next section).

We can use [`to-vfile`][to-vfile] to read and write virtual files from the file
system, and we can use [`vfile-reporter`][reporter] to report messages relating
to those files.
Letâ€™s install those.

```sh
npm install to-vfile vfile-reporter
```

â€¦and now unhook stdin/stdout from our example and use the file-system instead,
like so:

```diff
--- a/index.js
+++ b/index.js
@@ -1,4 +1,5 @@

 import remarkSlug from 'remark-slug'

+      writeSync(file)
+    },
+    (error) => {
+      throw error
+    }
+  )
```

If we now run our script on its own, without shell redirects, we get a report
showing everythingâ€™s fine:

```sh
$ node index.js
example.md: no issues found
```

But everythingâ€™s not fine, thereâ€™s a typo in the Markdown!
The next section shows how to detect prose errors by adding retext.

### Checking prose

I did notice a typo in there, so letâ€™s check some prose to prevent that from
happening in the future.
We can use retext and its ecosystem for our natural language parsing.
As weâ€™re writing in English, we use [`retext-english`][english] specifically to
parse English natural language.
The problem in our `example.md` file is that it has `a example` instead of
`an example`, which is conveniently checked for by
[`retext-indefinite-article`][indefinite-article].
To bridge from markup to prose, weâ€™ll use [`remark-retext`][remark-retext].
First, letâ€™s install these dependencies as well.

```sh
npm install remark-retext retext-english retext-indefinite-article
```

â€¦and change our `index.js` like so:

```diff
--- a/index.js
+++ b/index.js
@@ -4,12 +4,16 @@ import {unified} from 'unified'
 import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
 import remarkSlug from 'remark-slug'
 import remarkToc from 'remark-toc'
+import remarkRetext from 'remark-retext'
+import retextEnglish from 'retext-english'
+import retextIndefiniteArticle from 'retext-indefinite-article'
 import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'
 import rehypeDocument from 'rehype-document'
 import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'

 const processor = unified()
   .use(remarkParse)
+  .use(remarkRetext, unified().use(retextEnglish).use(retextIndefiniteArticle))
   .use(remarkSlug)
   .use(remarkToc)
   .use(remarkRehype)
```

As the code shows, `remark-retext` receives another `unified` middleware
pipeline.
A natural language pipeline.
The plugin will transform the origin syntax (Markdown) with the given pipelineâ€™s
parser.
Then, itâ€™ll run the attached plugins on the natural language syntax tree.

Now, when running our script one final time:

```sh
$ node index.js
example.md
  7:1-7:2  warning  Use `An` before `example`, not `A`  retext-indefinite-article  retext-indefinite-article

âš  1 warning
```

â€¦weâ€™ll get a useful message.

Youâ€™ve got a really cool system set up already, nicely done!
Thatâ€™s a wrap though, check out the next section for further exercises and
resources.
